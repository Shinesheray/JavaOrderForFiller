# JavaOrderForFiller
## My HyperionDev Level 2 Capstone project II A Java Order forfilment program


## What this is and what this project is for.
I created a order forfilment Program, which takes a users order details and reads a CSV/Text file which has the names and loction of drivers with their capacity. this program will match a user with the nearest driver and create an invioce for the user.
This program aslo ensures the CSV/Text file named Drivers.txt is updated, by updating the selected nearest drivers load capacity of the customers order
